I am a BigData enthusiast/consultant, working on Apache Hadoop from last four years. Presently working on building reliable bigdata applications using Apache Spark. 

I do Bigdata trainings for corporate and public in Banglore. I do Bigdata consulting for Apache Spark. I do actively organise Meetups in [Banglore Apache Spark Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Bangalore-Apache-Spark-Meetup/). 

Along with all the above activites I do write blogs in [Shashidhar Blog](http://shasidhar.github.io/).
